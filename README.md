## My favorite team sport is Basketball.
I like the sport basketball because it is very *entertaining*. The sport of basketball also takes a lot of time and effort to master especially if a player is trying to master the jumpshot. **However**, basketball can also be a little bit easier for some players if they were **gifted** with height.

The Los Angeles Lakers are my favorite basketball team.
